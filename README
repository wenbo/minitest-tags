please take a look at Rakefile, Gemfile, and test/helper.rb. that's it, right? 

    rake test               # run all test, just

    rake test:on[follow]    # only invoke the test case the desc inlcuding "follow" quoted by parenthesis

    rake test:on[login]     # only invoke the test case the desc inlcuding "login" quoted by parenthesis
